nss-pem
=======

This source embeds src:nss because it needs some headers and static libs
that the nss maintainer has refused to package, see bugs:

https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=855879
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=732201

if the situation changes and the files are packaged by src:nss then the
embedded copy can be dropped.

The files that libnsspem.so needs for its build are:
 private headers: alghmac.h blapi.h
 static libs: libfreebl.a nssb.a nssckfw.a
